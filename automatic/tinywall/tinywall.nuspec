    <summary>A free, lightweight and non-intrusive firewall</summary>
    <description>
## Features
TinyWall includes a combination of features that sets it apart from both commercial and freeware firewalls.
TinyWall does not annoy you with popups at all, yet it is still extremely easy to add exceptions to your firewall rules.
TinyWall actively blocks hundreds of trojans, viruses and worms.
TinyWall does not require you to know about ports, protocols and application details.
TinyWall prevents malicious programs from modifying the settings of Windows Firewall.
TinyWall does not install drivers or other kernel components, is free and lightweight.

## Notes
NOTE: After installation TinyWall blocks most communication. To use the internet or network-enabled applications, select one of the "Whitelist by ..." options in the tray menu to unblock specific programs.

Do not install TinyWall over a remote connection, or you will risk locking yourself out until TinyWall gets properly configured.

The upgrading and uninstalling are NOT silent.
